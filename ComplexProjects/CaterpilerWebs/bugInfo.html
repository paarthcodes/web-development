            The lackey moth <span>(Malacosoma neustria)</span> is a moth in the family Lasiocampidae. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his
            1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is common across southern Britain and central Europe. Malacosoma species are 
            notable for their caterpillars which are brightly coloured and form silken tents to regulate their temperature.
           Malacosoma neustria caterpillars are brown with blue, orange and white stripes. The adults are a fairly uniform brown.
            The larvae feed mainly on trees and shrubs from within their tents.

        <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
        <p>
            The lackey moth is widely distributed across Europe, Asia and North Africa. Its habitat is the edges of woodland, bushy 
            grassland, coppices, hedgerows and road verges. The caterpillar's food plants include apple, pear, plum, willow, hornbeam,
            lime and oak.

        <h2><span>Life Cycle</span></h2>
        <p>
            <span>As caterpillars, lacky moths create webs in certain types of trees.</span>
            There, they group together to eat leaves until they are ready
            to form cocoons to turn into moths!
