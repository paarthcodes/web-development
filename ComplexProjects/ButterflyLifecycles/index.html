        <p><span>All butterflies start as eggs in the first stage. </span> Eggs are laid attached
            to a branch or tucked safely on a leaf.  Butterfly eggs are very small!</p>

        <p><span>In the second stage, a caterpillar hatches from an egg.</span> A caterpillar looks 
            like a fat worm.  It feeds on leaves until it grows big enough.  
            It has two sets of specialized legs to help it grip branches.</p>

        <p><span>In the third stage, the caterpillar creates a chrysalis.</span> A chrysalis 
            usually hangs from a branch.  It's basically a tough shell that the 
            caterpillar builds around itself.  Then the caterpillar dissolves 
            into a liquid and rebuilds itself as a butterfly! </p>

        <p><span>The fouth and final stage is a butterfly.</span>The butterfly's final 
            form is grown inside the chrysalis.  When it's done forming, a butterfly 
            emerges from the chrysalis.  A butterfly has a head, thorax, abdomen, 
            and two wings.</p>
