        <p id="rain"><strong>Precipitation.</strong> When enough water has condensed into clouds, the water falls from clouds in precipitation, 
                which could be rain, snow, hail, sleet, etc.</p>
        <p id="drying"><strong>Evaporation.</strong> When the sun heats up water on the surface of the Earth, the water is 
            turned into water vapor and mixes into the air.  The water cools as it rises and starts condensing, 
            which means it starts turning into bigger water droplets.  These water droplets form clouds.</p>
        <p id="storage"><strong>Earth Water.</strong> Not all water is on the surface of the Earth.  Some if it gets stored
            in snowpack, iceburgs, rivers, lakes, the ocean, or even underground! </p>
